                At IIITB, we follow the notion of research labs and centers which is an abstraction of a particular
                theme/area.
                A research lab encompasses people, projects, physical facilities, and activities.
                A research center or a center of excellence is an abstraction either in terms of the broader set of
                research themes being followed or in terms of hierarchy of research activities.
                Please click on the respective research domain above to get more details about its focus of
                research, faculty members involved, and the active labs and centers.

        <p>Affordability, Accessibility and Availability of medical care and services are a major concern in India and
            similar other regions across the world. To address them, EHRC conducts applied research on Device, Data
            (generation, management, processing), and Delivery (services), with a goal of larger impact on, not only
            technologies of healthcare, but also health-related policies and capacity-building. Ongoing research
            projects at EHRC broadly fall under the areas of Public Health and Surgical & Assistive Robotics. Within
            these areas, the Centre welcomes applications on the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Electronic Health Record and Registries; Hospital and Field Operations Digitization</li>
            <li>User Experience Research and Participatory Design</li>
            <li>Diagnostic Support Systems; 3D Models and Visualization</li>
            <li>Image Guidance & Simulation; Image & Video Analytics</li>
            <li>Flexible Robots; Prosthetics & Assistive Devices; Ultrasound Probes</li>

        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>This Centre is looking for applications in the following research areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understanding the social basis of human cognition and learning, and examining how to incorporate that in
                machine learning.</li>
            <li>Understanding assumptions and biases in collecting "Big Data" and its implications in Machine Learning
                applications.</li>
            <li>Sliding mode control and non-linear control systems and theory with applications in single and groups of
                unmanned systems, such as aircraft and mobile robots.</li>
            <li>Automated image processing and computer vision using principles of feedback control systems, with an
                emphasis on industrial applications.</li>
            <li>Information convergence (ICON) is an evolution of the classical Enterprise Application Integration
                (EAI). While EAI is focussed on data integration across multiple sources for the purpose of transaction
                processing, ICON is focussed on information integration across multiple information sources for the
                purpose of analytics. Challenges in Information convergence span across a wide range of technologies and
                research areas including information management, data integration, natural language computing, image
                processing, optical character recognition and so on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Candidates with interdisciplinary research interests, such as the social shaping and implications of
            technology as well as Science & Technology Studies, are encouraged to apply.</p>
